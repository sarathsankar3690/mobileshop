<h1>Welcome to the Mobile store!</h1>

<p>We are happy tp help you!!
Do you know the feeling when you go out and realize you left your phone at home? Yeah, you know that feeling I´m talking about. The feeling like you are suddenly disconnected from the world. It feels like a part of you is almost missing and creeps in slowly but steadely no matter how hard you try to tell yourself ¨Oh it´s fine. I can go a few hours without my phone.¨Smartphones have become an inseparable part of our daily lives. We use it to set our morning alarm for work or school, to communicate with friends and family anywhere in the world on Whatsapp, listening to music on Spotify, reading News, watching YouTube videos, to check our emails, and as of course to take our daily selfies.
